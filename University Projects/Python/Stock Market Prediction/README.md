Stock market is pulled from yahoo finance and is preproccessed before training the LSTM model. The preprocessing consists of normalizing and reserving the earlier data as training data and the recent data as validation data.
The data is then cascaded based on the timestep size. It is best to use a few years worth of data because data from decades earlier does not represent the present day very well. A simple model with one LTSM layer with 32 nodes and one dense layer works well because predicting one stock price is considered a simple problem that requires a simple model. This avoids overfitting and has a better performance than adding dropout and regularizer to a more complex model The program will automatically save the weights with the lowest validation loss and then predict a number of forecast days.
