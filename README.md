# About Me

My experience in computer engineering at University of California, Santa Barbara focused on integrated circuit design and using AI/Machine Learning to solve problems. I have over eight years experience in computer programming mainly in C++, Javascript, and Python. My ability to collaborate with others to complete a large project is seen through the published CK-12 textbooks and my Capstone project. These projects also taught me how to work remotely and how to create a product that ensures quality for the user. These projects had their own editors, APIs, and interfaces, so I was able to learn very quickly and produce results within the first month.

I have a passion for using technology to make a positive impact on the world. Advancing technology is important to solve the biggest threats the world sees today. I also strive to ensure no corners get cut during the design process to ensure maximum quality and reliability.

If you have any job or research opportunites in hardware or sofware, contact me at coreyzh@gmail.com.

# Math Interactives Internship, CK-12 Foundation

CK-12 is a non profit organization that has made free digital interactive textbooks for students ranging from kindergarten to high school. I designed many of the interactive programs in the middle and high school math textbooks. The interactives were made with Geogebra, which is a math calculator/editor with a Javascript-based API. I was also responsible for testing and quality assurance for other content made by other interns.

# Senior Capstone Project

Every senior in the engineering department was tasked to complete an engineering project in one school year. My team was given the project to create an autonomous marine vehicle that will automatically move towards and stay near coordinates given by the user. I was mainly in charge of the cellular communication and the main software program inside the system. Due to Covid-19, most of the project was completed remotely with only the final contruction being in person.
