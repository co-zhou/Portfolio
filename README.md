I am a recent graduate of University of California Santa Barbara with a bachelor's degree in computer engineering. I have over five years experience in computer programming mainly in C++ and Python with a focus on AI/Machine Learning, but also with Java/Javascript. My ability to collaborate with others to complete a large project is seen through the published CK-12 textbooks and my Capstone project. These projects also taught me how to work remotely and how to create a product that ensures quality for the user. These projects had their own editors, APIs, and interfaces, so I was able to learn very quickly and produce results within the first month.

My other main focus in school is digital circuit design. I have taken many classes ranging from computer architecture to digital design test verification and automation and VLSI design. I have created complicated systems including pipelined processors in Verilog and VLSI circuits modeled as a SUE schematic, then simulated through HSpice.

# Math Interactives Internship, CK-12 Foundation
Summer 2018 - Summer 2019

CK-12 is a non profit organization that has made free digital interactive textbooks for students ranging from kindergarten to high school. I designed many of the interactive programs in the middle and high school math textbooks. The interactives were made with Geogebra, which is a math calculator/editor with a Javascript-based API. I was also responsible for testing and quality assurance for other content made by other interns.

# Senior Capstone Project
Fall 2020 - Spring 2021

Every senior in the engineering department was tasked to complete an engineering project in one school year. My team was given the project to create an autonomous marine vehicle that will automatically move towards and stay near coordinates given by the user. I was mainly in charge of the cellular communication and the main software program inside the system. Due to Covid-19, most of the project was completed remotely with only the final contruction being in person.
