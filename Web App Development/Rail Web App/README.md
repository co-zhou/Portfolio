This is a simplified implementation of a passenger train web app. The application is initialized with random fake data stored in a MySQL database. New users when opening the homepage will see a list of all the train routes.
You can register a new user or login to an existing user and flask-session will authenticate and save the session. When logged in on the homepage, you can add a train route to your profile. On the users page, you can view the
routes you have added and can remove them at the bottom.
